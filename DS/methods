ðŸ“Œ Next Topics After Stacks
1. Queues

Concept: FIFO (First In, First Out)

Types:

Simple Queue

Circular Queue

Deque (Double Ended Queue)

Priority Queue (Heap-based)

Implementation:

Using Arrays

Using Linked List

Using Python collections.deque

Problems:

Implement Queue using Stacks

Sliding Window Maximum (ðŸ”¥)

Rotten Oranges (BFS style)

2. Recursion

Youâ€™ll need recursion everywhere later (trees, backtracking, DP).

Learn:

Factorial, Fibonacci

Sum of array, reverse string

Tower of Hanoi

Backtracking basics

3. Trees

Binary Tree Basics (preorder, inorder, postorder)

Binary Search Tree (BST)

Level-order Traversal (Queue + Tree combo)

Common problems (height of tree, symmetric tree, diameter, LCA, etc.)

4. Hashing

Hash Maps / Hash Sets (Python dict & set)

Problems:

Two Sum

Subarray sum = K

First Non-repeating Character

ðŸ“Œ Suggested Path (So you donâ€™t get lost)

Linked List âœ…

Stacks âœ…

Queues (next for you)

Recursion

Trees (BT + BST)

Hashing

Then â†’ Graphs, Heaps, Tries, Dynamic Programming (later advanced).
